# Model-Reference-Adaptive-Control---MIT-Rule

In this repository, I posted MATLAB codes for simulating the behavior of a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm. 
A detailed post that explains the basics of the MRAC algorithm is given here:

A YouTube video explaining the MRAC algorithm is given here

The files are: 
1.) "main_file_adaptive.m" - the main file for simulating the dynamics. You can start from this file.
2.) "dynamics_adaptive.m" - the MATLAB function describing the closed-loop dynamics.
